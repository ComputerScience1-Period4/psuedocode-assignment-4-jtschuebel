Give each player 5 cards
Check your 5 cards for mathcing cards

If: four of a kind:
  That player will put the four cards down on the playing surface.
  Else: 
    If: no matching cards 
      Ask a specific player who you think has a card that matches yours
      
if the other player has the card, you give the number of cards you have that matches the description to the player for what he asked for
if the other player doesnt have the card, they tell the person asking to go fish
if the person asking for a card gets told go fish then the person has to pick up a card from the deck
if a person who gets asked for a card and doesn't have the card and hasn't drawn a card dont ask him
if a person asks a player for a card and gets the card, when its your turn and you have a card that matches the card he asked for then ask for the cards he got
repeat until the deck is gone
person who has the most stacks of four of a kind once the deck is gone then that person wins the game
